         <h2>Notes - Master Mobile UX</h2>
         <br>
         <h3>Mobile First User Experience</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>A primary reason for developing for the least powerful device first is so that you can focus on content and core functionality.</li>
         <li>Multiple devices per household, multiple sizes</li>
         <li>Whatever you are coding, do mobile first (Eric Schmidt)</li>
         <li>Responsive Retrofitting != Mobile First</li>
         <li>Start small and scale up – things tend to grow better</li>
        </ul>

         It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you shot it to them – Steve Jobs
         
         Immediate >> Relevant >> Frictionless
         Be there >> Be Useful >> Be Quick 
         Make interactions smooth and seamless
         
         Reachability
         75% rely on their thumbs
         Easier to reach things at the bottom of the device
         
         Speed Matters
         ½ second delay = 20% drop in traffic
         2 second day = 4% drop in revenue (Bing)
         Reduce image size
         SVG/webfonts lower bandwith
         optimize and minify CSS and JS files
         GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data
         
         Primary Controls
         Move main nav bar to bottom of screen to make more reachable
         Keep it simple, and fluid
         Hamburger menu – not intuitive = word “menu” with a border 20% more clicks than hamburger menu alone
         
         Mobile Inputs / Forms
         Make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first.
         Reduce cognitive load and make them think less.
         Display labels inside fields – use float labels (so label displays at the top of the field)
         Check boxes larger, easier to press
         Be careful about how many 
         Paginate the form or eliminate non-required fields
         Enable auto-complete on forms
         Show passwords, not hide them, to make it easier for people to enter them, but allow users to hide the passwords if they want to. This was the suggestion – honestly, I would not like this on a site, and I don’t think I would apply this suggestion in anything I would develop.
         
         Enter Credit Card details
         Space out the numbers evenly
         consider putting cc numbers, expiration date, CID, and zip code on the same line, and auto-advance
         Just trying to make it easier for people to enter their payment information
         
         User the right keyboard – i.e., number pad for credit card entry
         Use a standard anchor tag with the telephone number in the attribute to make calls easier to make
         
         “End-users, not tech, shapes the market” – Matt Haig
         
         Mobile advertising
         $25 Billion to $150 Billion over 5 year period, 2013-2017
         Still, ads are designed for desktops
         Pop-up and in-betweener ads – most detested methods of advertising on a mobile device
         Make ads small and simple
         Expand size of the ad when clicked, so they can see it if they want to, but keep it small
         Video ads result in higher conversion rates
         Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs
         Keep it simple and sleek
         Content first – make it unobtrusive as possible
         Keep it simple, keep it appropriate, and think outside the box
