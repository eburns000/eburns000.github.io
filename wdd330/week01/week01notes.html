         <h3>Mobile First User Experience</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>A primary reason for developing for the least powerful device first is so that you can focus on content
               and core functionality.</li>
            <li>Multiple devices per household, multiple sizes</li>
            <li>Responsive Retrofitting != Mobile First</li>
            <li>Start small and scale up – things tend to grow better</li>
            <li>Immediate -- Relevant -- Frictionless</li>
            <li>Be there -- Be Useful -- Be Quick </li>
            <li>Make interactions smooth and seamless</li>
         </ul>

         <blockquote>"It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they
            want until you show it to them" – Steve Jobs</blockquote>

         <p class="question">Do you think app development is going to decline? I was going to take this
            course a couple of years ago, and at the time, it was more focused on mobile web development, and I thought
            at the time, why
            focus on that when I'm more interested in building native apps that are more responsive than an actual
            website designed for a mobile device. Now, it seems like more and more websites are being designed for
            mobile. This produces a major advantage in that you don't have to design an app for the market place, and
            it's much easier to convert a user to your website than an app. It takes a lot more committment from a user
            to take the time to actually install an app. So is native app development going to decline in the future?

         <h3>Reachability</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>75% rely on their thumbs</li>
            <li>Easier to reach things at the bottom of the device</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Speed Matters</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1/2 second delay = 20% drop in traffic</li>
            <li>2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue (Bing)</li>
            <li>Reduce image size</li>
            <li>SVG/webfonts lower bandwidth</li>
            <li>Optimize and Minify CSS and JS Files</li>
            <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
         </ul>

         <p class="question">What do you use to minify your CSS and JS files?</p>

         <h3>Primary Controls</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Move main nav bar to bottom of screen to make more reachable</li>
            <li>Keep it simple, and fluid</li>
            <li>Hamburger menu - not intuitive = word "menu" with a border 20% more clicks than hamburger menu alone
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Mobile Inputs / Forms</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first.</li>
            <li>Reduce cognitive load and make them think less.</li>
            <li>Display labels inside fields – use float labels (so label displays at the top of the field)</li>
            <li>Check boxes larger, easier to press</li>
            <li>Be careful about how many fields on the form</li>
            <li>Consider paginating the form or eliminate non-required fields</li>
            <li>Enable auto-complete on forms</li>
            <li>Show passwords, not hide them, to make it easier for people to enter them, but allow users to hide the
               passwords if they want to. This was the suggestion – honestly, I would not like this on a site, and I
               don’t think I would apply this suggestion in anything I would develop.</li>
            <li>Enter Credit Card details</li>
            <li>Space out the numbers evenly</li>
            <li>Consider putting cc numbers, expiration date, CID, and zip code on the same line, and auto-advance</li>
            <li>Just trying to make it easier for people to enter their payment information</li>
            <li>User the right keyboard – i.e., number pad for credit card entry</li>
            <li>Use a standard anchor tag with the telephone number in the attribute to make calls easier to make</li>
         </ul>

         <blockquote>“End-users, not tech, shapes the market” – Matt Haig</blockquote>

         <p class="question">Would anyone seriously consider not hiding the passwords in a password field by default? I
            use multiple sites, as I'm sure you all do as well, that require authentication, and I cannot think of one
            site that does not hide the password, even if they allow the last character to be seen.</p>

         <p class="question">What real world templates are out there to use for forms, including payment forms? What
            have you found? I know in the class we're not wanting to use frameworks, but I think it would be helpful to
            understand the resources that are out there.</p>

         <h3>Mobile Advertising</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>$25 Billion to $150 Billion over 5 year period, 2013-2017</li>
            <li>Still, ads are designed for desktops</li>
            <li>Pop-up and in-betweener ads – most detested methods of advertising on a mobile device</li>
            <li>Make ads small and simple</li>
            <li>Expand size of the ad when clicked, so they can see it if they want to, but keep it small</li>
            <li>Video ads result in higher conversion rates</li>
            <li>Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs</li>
            <li>Keep it simple and sleek</li>
            <li>Content first – make it unobtrusive as possible</li>
            <li>Keep it simple, keep it appropriate, and think outside the box</li>
         </ul>

         <p class="question">I don't know how to connect advertising to a site. Has anyone used Google Adsense, and what
            other tools are out there to monitize a site?</p>
