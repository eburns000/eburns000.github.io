            <li>A primary reason for developing for the least powerful device first is so that you can focus on content
               and core functionality.</li>
            <li>Multiple devices per household, multiple sizes</li>
            <li>Responsive Retrofitting != Mobile First</li>
            <li>Start small and scale up – things tend to grow better</li>
            <li>Immediate -- Relevant -- Frictionless</li>
            <li>Be there -- Be Useful -- Be Quick </li>
            <li>Make interactions smooth and seamless</li>
         </ul>

         <blockquote>"It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they
            want until you show it to them" – Steve Jobs</blockquote>

         <p class="question">Do you think app development is going to decline? I was going to take this
            course a couple of years ago, and at the time, it was more focused on mobile web development, and I thought
            at the time, why
            focus on that when I'm more interested in building native apps that are more responsive than an actual
            website designed for a mobile device. Now, it seems like more and more websites are being designed for
            mobile. This produces a major advantage in that you don't have to design an app for the market place, and
            it's much easier to convert a user to your website than an app. It takes a lot more committment from a user
            to take the time to actually install an app. So is native app development going to decline in the future?
