         <h1>Target Audience</h1>
         <p>The target audience is somewhat broad, including men and women, age 18-45, who are adventure seekers,
            outdoor enthusiasts, hikers and/or mountain climbers. The Bear River Range has several trails and climbs
            that will appeal to varied levels of skill – from the non-technical climb to the summit of Sherman Peak to
            several areas of rugged cliffs accessible through the Highline National Recreation Trail. The site needs to
            address those interested in hiking trails that are suited to families as well as options for more technical
            climbs throughout the range.
         </p>

         </ul>
         <p>Russel is a native of Southeast Idaho and loves the outdoors and mountain climbing. He’s already familiar
            with many of the trails and climbs in the Bear River Range, but he needs to know the current weather and
            trail conditions for his favorite climbs and seeks updates on weather so he can plan for his climb for the
            upcoming weekend. He also enjoys seeing updates of other climbers, reviews, and pictures of climbs they have
            made and submitted to the site and learning new routes. He would be accessing the site using his iPhone 6,
            because he cannot afford the latest iPhone, but values smartphone technology. He would be viewing the site
            while out with his friends in the evening time on a weeknight, planning which trails and hikes to take the
            weekend, checking the weather to make sure they’ll be able to have a safe climb.

         </ul>
         <p>Kimberlie lives in Ogden, UT with her family and is vacationing in Bear Lake with her extended family at one
            of the many lodges. She is sitting on the sofa in the early morning before the kids are awake, looking for
            hikes and trails she can take her young family on in the area later that day. She wants to make sure the
            weather will cooperate and that the trails will be safe and clear. She enjoys the outdoors and taking her
            family on excursions but is not a technical climber and is looking for easy family hikes. She also wants to
            know where the trailhead is and how long it will take to get there. She would be accessing the site using
            her laptop.
