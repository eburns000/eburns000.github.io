               <p>
                  The design of Chelan PUD's home page demonstrates an understanding of Fitt's law. On the mobile site there are three buttons, all prominent and all within easy reach of the thumb.
                  <br><br>
                  Each button get's the same "weight" although I think your eye natrually gravitates the center of the three options first, which is to "Pay your bill."

               <p>
                  The design of Confluence Health's home page demonstrates the use of design principle of repetition. The screenshot is taken from the home page, albeit slightly scrolled down to demontrate this principle.
                  <br><br>
                  The light blue color (#0095d5) in the letter "C" of the logo and in the word "Confluence" is repeated throughout the site, in both background color or selected blocks, text color, and graphics, and button color.

               <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
               <h3>Worx Gym</h3>
               <a href="https://www.yourworkoutrx.com/" target="_blank">yourworkoutrx.com</a>
               <img src="images/img-worx-400.png" alt="worx gym">
               <p>
                  This site employs several uses of good design, including alignment, contrast and repetition, but for this example, I wanted to highlight the designer's use of the rule of thirds. The rule of thirds says that an image should be divided into nine equal parts. In the image on this site, the word "Your" is in the top and left third of the image and the image of the person is in the right third of the image.
                  <br><br>
                  In addition, the person's arm, leg and back creates a triangle, which draws your eye diagonally across the image from the logo, through the call to action, and the person's gym shoe, perhaps a deliberate message to the user that it is "time to get moving." By following the rule of thirds in the positioning of the text and the person in the image, the user is inspired to act.
